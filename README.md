# Description

D&Discord is a Discord Bot designed to roll dice in Discord channels, much like the dice rolling mechanisms of Roll 20.

## Formatting

The text input in the channel must be of the form:
```/r 1d6+1d4```
or
```/roll 1d6+1d4```
with only one space after the command word and no spaces between the dice rolls.
